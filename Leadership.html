                The Patriots dynasty was led by a core group of people. Mainly being head coach Bill Belechick and quarterback Tom Brady. 
            The leadership of these two men carried the Patriots to their 6 super bowl wins. 
                Throughout the dynesty the Patriots had one saying that was crucial to who they were and their success. This saying was what 
            Belechick preached nearly everyday and it was, "do your job." 
                This saying is what the Patriots lived by. The theory was If everyone does their job on and off the feild, the Patriots
            would win. And that is exactly what happened.
