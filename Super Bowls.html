            The Patriots have won 6 championships in their franchise. All 6 came with Tom Brady at quarterback and came during the dynasty.
        This run the Patriots had created a close nit community for Boston sports fans. 
            The first 3 superbowl wins all came from game winning feild goal kicks from kicker Adam Viniteri. The patriots 6 superbowl wins in 
        order came against the Rams, Panthers, Eagles, Seahawks, Falcons, and Rams again. 
            The superbowl win against the Falcons is a special one however and it solitified Tom Brady as being an all-time great quarterback. 
        In this game he led the Patriots back from being down 25 points in the 3rd quarter to beat the Falcons in overtime. It is the largest
        comeback iun super bowl history.
